We do not store any of the data in our servers (except during processing momentarily, which will be erased soon after). After each search, the last searched profile data is stored locally (on your device) for faster reaccess. You can remove this by using 'Forget profile' option in settings. The data accessed from MAL include: username, profile picture & other profile information, anime list, activity history. We do not run any analytics software as of now."
